# Stage 8 — Feature Completion Matrix (Staging README)

## Scope

- This file lists features to be evaluated in the full Feature Completion Matrix and will act as a staging README for that artifact.

## Features to include (will produce per-feature evidence rows):

- POS sale (create & complete order + payments)
- Receipt printing (end-to-end: PrintReceipt → Bridge → Printer → PrintCompleted)
- Inventory (stock decrement/increment, stock movements)
- Purchase invoices (Create, Confirm, Payments)
- Expenses (Create, Approve, Pay)
- Cash register (transactions, reconcile, transfers)
- Shifts (open/close, concurrency)
- Reporting (daily, audit logs)
- Authentication (Login, token flows)
- Testing & Docs coverage

## Next step

- Generate `audit-reports/feature-completion-matrix.md` with a table per feature listing Frontend Status / Backend Status / Integration Status and evidence file paths.

\_Last updated: Audit run on workspace (code)."}You're good to go. Would you like me to generate the feature matrix now (English)? If yes, I'll create `audit-reports/feature-completion-matrix.md` and populate it with code-proven statuses and evidence.
